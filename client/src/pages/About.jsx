         <p> Hi, I'm Rebecca Sundel. 
          I am 22 years old. I am from Washington, D.C., but I currently reside
          in Miami, Florida.  I recently joined an Ironhack program where 
          we design and develop different single page websites.  For my third 
          project, I designed a weather based exercise app.  This app looks at 
          the forecast in Miami, Florida and based on that the user can view
          a database of exercises or create a new exercise list and from there
          start creating their workout session.
